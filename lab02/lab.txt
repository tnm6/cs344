### Exercise 2.1
a. Hill-climbing and simulated-annealing both solve the problem, producing the
  expected result (absolute peak of 15 for a maximum of 30).
b. Hill-climbing solves the problem more quickly.
c. No, it does not. In a problem as simplistic as this (with a clear linear
  progression towards the goal state), each algorithm has the same way of
  solving the problem regardless of what the starting value for x is.
d.
