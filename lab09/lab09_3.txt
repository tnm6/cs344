a.  Try Chollet’s “Further experiments”. Do any of the alternatives do better
    than the suggested architecture? Why or why not?
  None of the alternatives showed better results than the suggested
architecture. While some changes produce higher accuracy/lower loss for the
training data, none produced more accurate results for the test data. This is
likely due to how changes to density and number of layers can lead to
overfitting. Other changes, like relu to tanh for activation function, do not
perform as well because relu is a better fit for binary classification. The
same can be said for replacing binary cross-entropy with MSE, since the former
is especially effective for this type of problem.
