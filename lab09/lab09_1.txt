Answers by Nathan Meyer (tnm6)

a.  How effective is the linear regression approach to the problem?
  Largely ineffective. Training the model yields almost no curve in loss
reduction of any sort, and the reduction that is there is gradual and
inconsistent (spikes in higher error during a few periods).
