a.  How effective is the linear regression approach to the problem?
  Largely ineffective. Training the model yields almost no curve in loss
reduction of any sort, and the reduction that is there is gradual and
inconsistent (spikes in higher error during a few periods).

b. Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss.
  L2 Loss is the Mean Squared Error which all of the linear regression
exercises have been based upon, which are then printed out as the Root Mean
Squared Error to be more understandable. This uses the fairly straightforward
mean squared error metric on the predictions compared to the actual targets.
  LogLoss is a more sophisticated approach where the target probability y is
negated then multiplied by the log of the prediction y-pred, then subtracted
from that is the complement (1 - y) * lg(1 - y-pred). The sum of these
calculations is then used to calculate loss. This is a more effective approach
when more granular changes in probability (e.g., 0.9 and 0.9999) need to be
properly accounted for. 

c.  Task 2: Explain how effective logistic regression is compared with linear
    regression.
  Logistic Regression and LogLoss produced a more consistent curve in loss
reduction, although the calculated LogLoss error is higher than the RMSE (0.53
for LogLoss vs. 0.44 for RMSE). This might be more accurate to the "actual"
loss. However, it's worth noting that the curve still had fluctuation, where
loss increased around period 3 before going down again.

d.  Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy
    and what hyperparameters you used to get them.
  learning_rate=0.000002,
  steps=15000,
  batch_size=500

  LogLoss: 0.47; AUC: 0.81; Accuracy: 0.77
