a.  Why are we regularizing with respect to sparsity?
  High sparsity often leads to vectors with many dimensions, so regularizing
with respect to sparsity can help to "zero out" certain features, meaning they
are essentially removed. This saves memory and can also reduce noise. This is
particularly possible in L1 Regularization which encourages coefficients to be
0 where possible.
