Exercise 10.1 of Lab 8
CS-344, Professor Vander Linden, Calvin University
Answers by Nathan Meyer (tnm6)

a.  Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?
  Keras, from what I can tell. TensorFlow itself probably has some greater
degree of control than Keras since so much more of the configuration is set
manually, but Keras' "higher level" code, which abstracts away much of the
configuration, could save considerable time in setting up models.

b.  Tasks 1 & 2: Report your best hyper-parameter settings and their resulting
    performance on the testing dataset.

  learning_rate=0.00075,
  steps=5000,
  batch_size=100,
  hidden_units=[10, 10]

  Final RMSE (on training data):    101.00
  Final RMSE (on validation data):  100.99
  Final RMSE (on test data):        99.18
