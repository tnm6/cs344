a.  Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?
  It shows which digits might be confused for other digits, one example being
7s and 1s. By confused, this means that these particular digits might be prone
to being classified incorrectly when mistakenly identified for its similar
digit.

b.  Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from
    the Keras example given in class? Report any improvements you can make over
    the baseline testset accuracy for this task.
  Compared to the Keras implementation of the MNIST problem, the TensorFlow
implementation uses two hidden layers that are 100 nodes wide, whereas the
Keras implementation used one hidden layer which was 512 nodes wide.

  I was unable to improve over the baseline accuracy.
