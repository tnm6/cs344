b. gps.py file
  i.    The GPS problem solver is implemented as a function.
  ii.   They are lists of strings.
  iii.  Yes. gps() runs achieve_all(), which runs achieve() for each goal, and
      achieve() runs apply_operator() for each operator. Within
      apply_operator() it calls achieve_all() for any pre-conditions, thus
      recursively calling the sequence.

d. Running monkeys.py
  i.    It models the monkey and banana problem, where bananas are suspended
      from the ceiling just out of reach of the monkey. In order to reach them,
      the monkey must use the chair (and in this case, drop a ball) to climb up
      in order to grab the bananas. The code seems to faithfully implement this
      puzzle, with the addition of having to drop a ball that the monkey
      initially has in his hand.
  ii.   Based on a list of states given (preconditions, added, and deleted
      conditions), the GPS determines how to progress through the given list in
      order to reach its intended state, 'not hungry.' If we think through the
      states in reverse order, we see that in order to reach 'not hungry,' the
      action 'eat bananas' must be taken, which, given the preconditions, can
      only be performed if the monkey 'has bananas,' which is achieved through
      the action 'grasp bananas,' which itself can only be achieved if the
      monkey is both 'at bananas' and 'empty handed' and so on. So the GPS
      performs the tasks necessary to work through each state and its problems,
      until it finally can perform 'eat bananas' which results in the goal 'not
      hungry.'
  iii.  Yes, the GPS in this problem is artificially intelligent by the
      category of thinking humanly (cognitive modeling). It models the way in
      which human intelligence can trace its reasoning through steps, as shown
      in how it solves the monkey and banana problem. At the same time, though,
      the GPS requires the user to define each state, and which states can be
      reached from which actions, instead of the GPS figuring that out itself.
      So it fits the cognitive modeling approach, but it's not very independent
      in its problem-solving.
  iv.   In terms of basic problem solving, yes, a real-world scenario where the
      monkey solves this problem would be showing intelligence. In fact, it 
      could be showing more intelligence than the GPS in certain instances. If
      the monkey solves the problem without being shown or informed of its
      options beforehand, then it might be displaying more intelligence than
      the GPS which, as in the previous answer, needs to be told its actions
      and possible states.
