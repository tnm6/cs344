b. gps.py file
  i.    The GPS problem solver is implemented as a function.
  ii.   They are lists of strings.
  iii.  Yes. gps() runs achieve_all(), which runs achieve() for each goal, and
      achieve() runs apply_operator() for each operator. Within
      apply_operator() it calls achieve_all() for any pre-conditions, thus
      recursively calling the sequence.

d. Running monkeys.py
  i.    It models the monkey and banana problem, in which a ball with bananas
      is suspended on the ceiling, out of reach of the monkey. The monkey must
      use a chair and a stick in order to reach them. The program models seems
      to model this accurately, requiring each step for the monkey to perform.
  ii.
