b. gps.py file
  i.    The GPS problem solver is implemented as a function.
  ii.   They are lists of strings.
  iii.  Yes. gps() runs achieve_all(), which runs achieve() for each goal, and
      achieve() runs apply_operator() for each operator. Within
      apply_operator() it calls achieve_all() for any pre-conditions, thus
      recursively calling the sequence.

d. Running monkeys.py
  i.    It models the monkey and banana problem, in bananas are suspended from
      the ceiling just out of reach of the monkey. In order to reach them, the
      monkey must use the chair (and in this case, drop a ball) to climb up in
      order to grab the bananas. The code seems to faithfully implement this
      puzzle, with the addition of having to drop a ball that the monkey
      initially has in his hand.
  ii.   Based on a list of states given (preconditions, added, and deleted
      conditions), the GPS determines how to progress through the given list in
      order to reach its intended state, 'not hungry.' If we think through the
      states in reverse order, we see that in order to reach 'not hungry,' the
      action 'eat bananas' must be taken, which, given the preconditions, can
      only be performed if the monkey 'has bananas,' which is achieved through
      the action 'grasp bananas,' which itself can only be achieved if the
      monkey is both 'at bananas' and 'empty handed' and so on. So the GPS
      performs the tasks necessary to work through each state and its problems,
      until it finally can perform 'eat bananas' which results in the goal 'not
      hungry.'
