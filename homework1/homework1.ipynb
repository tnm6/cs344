    "Introspection might offer some uniquely intimate insights into reasoning, emotions, and responses of individuals. In that way, it might offer some insight into how that might be modeled in an AI. At the same time, as a part of one's own perception, it might be difficult to ascertain reliable and quantifiable details that could translate to a computing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the reliability and accuracy of an individual's introspection could be problematic. What an individual perceives to be their mental processes may not be entirely accurate to what is really happening, and their perceptions could vary wildly from individual to individual. So modeling an AI on one person's perceptions of their mental processes might not only be inaccurate to how these processes really work, they might also be inconsistent with the processes of other individuals.

    "### Reflection\n",
    "The results between hill-climbing and simulated annealing are comparable. With randomly generating the distances between each city, sometimes hill-climbing will produce a lower overall distance value, and sometimes simulated annealing will. The difference is rarely greater than about 5. As for the times, hill-climbing is much faster: it usually takes 0.002-0.004 seconds, while simulated annealing takes anywhere from 0.095-0.120 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense, given that hill-climbing is simply a loop to find the \"best\" neighboring state; in this case, it's simply the value closest to 0 (due to producing negative values). The algorithm is not computationally intensive, so it is unsurprising that is considerably faster than simulated annealing. Given that simulated annealing is inherently more complex, the slower time also makes sense. However, it is curious that hill-climbing will occasionally produce equivalent or *better* results than simulated annealing. Perhaps this is because the problem is set up such that it is relatively \"easy\" for both algorithms to find a similarly suitable solution. However, in the cases of when hill-climbing produces a worse solution, it is easy to imagine that it gets stuck, given its simplicity. At the same time, since the problem is NP-hard, it can be possible that something like simulated annealing cannot properly solve for the best value, thereby allowing hill-climbing to occasionally perform better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, both were pretty slow on larger sets of cities. For 100 cities, hill-climbing took 27 seconds to find a solution, and simulated-annealing took just under 60 seconds."
