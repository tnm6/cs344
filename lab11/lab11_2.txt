Answers by Nathan Meyer (tnm6)

a.  Task 1: What are the biases present in the given dataset?
  The data is not evenly distributed between men and women (about 2/3rds men and
1/3rd women), and the vast majority of the adults are white. Another apparent
skew is that most of the examples are from those working in the private sector.
Each of these could skew the results toward biased or inaccurate performance.
  Also, capital gains and losses both show and extreme skew towards 0, which 

b.  Task 2: Assess the potential bias in some other feature besides education
    level.
  In comparing marital status of men and women, women outnumber men in the
widowed category significantly (roughly 7: or 8:1), but the women listed as
married is closer to 1:6 compared to men. This suggests that married women are
being underrepresented, in addition to the disparity of the overall data between
men and women.

d.  Task 4: Do you find disparities when you look at race rather than gender?
    If so, which way do they skew?
  Yes. For race, White had a slightly better distribution between true positives
and true negatives, suggesting more of the examples categorized as White were in
the income bracket of >$50K. For the other races, there was a significant skew
towards the model guessing in the negative range. For Black, for example, the
negatives far outweighed the positives (82 true positives vs 1192 true
negatives), and of the positives, only 62% of them were guessed correctly.
Similar skews are seen in the other Race categories.
  This suggests that the income bracketing is biased towards the White examples.
