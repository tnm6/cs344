a.  Task 1: What are the biases present in the given dataset?
  The data is not evenly distributed between men and women (about 2/3rds men and
1/3rd women), and the vast majority of the adults are white. Another apparent
skew is that most of the examples are from those working in the private sector.
Each of these could skew the results toward biased or inaccurate performance.
