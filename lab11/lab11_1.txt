a.  Task 1: Is a linear model ever preferable to a deep NN model?
  A linear model may require less data, and less time to train. Some problems
might only need the relative simplicity of a linear model, so it would not make
sense to add the complexity and intensive data/performance requirements of a
deep NN.
