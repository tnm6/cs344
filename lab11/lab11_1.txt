Answers by Nathan Meyer (tnm6)

a.  Task 1: Is a linear model ever preferable to a deep NN model?
  A linear model may require less data, and less time to train. Some problems
might only need the relative simplicity of a linear model, so it would not make
sense to add the complexity and intensive data/performance requirements of a
deep NN. However, where accuracy is of the utmost priority, a NN would be the
ideal choice.

b.  Task 2: Does the NN model do better than the linear model?
  Its accuracy is notably higher, 84% vs 78.34%, and the average loss is notably
lower, 0.32 vs 0.45, for the test set, so yes, it performs better than the
linear model.

c.  Task 3: Do embeddings do much good for sentiment analysis tasks?
  Not really in this case. Without embeddings, the deep NN had an accuracy of
84% while, with an embedding layer added, had an accuracy of 78% on the test
set. The average loss, AUC, etc. are also worse.
