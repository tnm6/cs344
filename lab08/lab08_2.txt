a.  What does the Pearson correlation coefficient measure? Identify one example
    value from the correlation table you compute and explain why it makes sense
  It measures a correlation value from -1.0 to 1.0, 0.0 is no correlation and
the two ends mean negative and positive correlations, respectively.
  For example, total_rooms has a 0.9 (nearly perfect) positive correlation with
number of households per block. This makes sense because it is logical to think
that, on average, more houses in a block will amount to more rooms in that
block. The .1 can account for exceptions, where certain houses might have more
rooms than other houses.
