a.  Submit solutions to tasks 1–5.
Task 1:
    The range of median income is odd: 0.5–15.0 for both sets. Is this in
  hundreds of thousands? Or is it not a linear scale? And is 15.0 a cutoff?
    The minimum value for rooms per person is 0.0 but the minimums for
  total_rooms and population are 2.0 and 3.0 respectively. This could be due to
  rounding a very small total_rooms divided by a larger population value, but
  it seems odd in practice to have a 0.0 value for room_per_person. This is
  probably due to a simple rounding approach for decimals lower than 0.1.
    The median_house_value seems to be cut off at 500.0. Both sets have this
  maximum despite a more granular range of values for mean, etc., although the
  min values are also 15.0.
Task 2:
