1. Exercise 7.2 from AIMA

Given:
  mythical => immortal
  ¬mythical => ¬immortal ^ mammal
  immortal v mammal => horned
  horned => magical

Prove:
  - mythical
    Cannot be proven. There are no rules in which mythical is an outcome. It is
  only the specifying condition for two of the rules. Since mythical is not
  given in any other sentence, it cannot be proven with just these.
    
  - horned
    Although we do not know whether the unicorn is mythical or not, we can know
  from the rule for mythical and the rule for ¬mythical that the unicorn is
  either immortal or a mortal mammal. In either the case of the unicorn being
  immortal or a mammal, it is horned, so the unicorn must be horned.

  - magical
    The unicorn is therefore magical. Since it is proven to be horned, by the
  horned => magical rule, the unicorn is also magical.

Prolog?:
    I would think that you could program this problem into Prolog. The implies
  statement a => b is simply translated to the b:- a rule in Prolog. For the
  conjunctions and the negations, it would not be a straightforward, 4-sentence
  ruleset like it is in propositional logic. Where the left-hand side would have
  conjunctions, some intermediate rules would have to be written. The negation
  (/+) operator could also be used, though only on the right-hand side.


2. Solution for LPN! Exercise 2.4:

crossword(H1, H2, H3, V1, V2, V3) :-
  word(H1,_,H1V1,_,H1V2,_,H1V3,_),
  word(H2,_,H2V1,_,H2V2,_,H2V3,_),
  word(H3,_,H3V1,_,H3V2,_,H3V3,_),
  word(V1,_,H1V1,_,H2V1,_,H3V1,_),
  word(V2,_,H1V2,_,H2V2,_,H3V2,_),
  word(V3,_,H1V3,_,H2V3,_,H3V3,_),
  H1 \= V1, H2 \= V2, H3 \= V3.

Printed solutions when run on SWI-Prolog:
  H1 = astante,
  H2 = cobalto,
  H3 = pistola,
  V1 = astoria,
  V2 = baratto,
  V3 = statale ;
  H1 = astoria,
  H2 = baratto,
  H3 = statale,
  V1 = astante,
  V2 = cobalto,
  V3 = pistola ;
  false.
