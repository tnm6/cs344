a. Submit your solutions to exercises 1â€“2.
Exercise 1:
  cities['Big Saint City?'] = 
      cities['City name'].apply(lambda val: val.startswith('San')) &
      cities['Area square miles'].apply(lambda val: val > 50)
Exercise 2:
  cities.reindex([0, 2, 4])
  This command produces useful values for 0 and 2, but for 4, all values in
each column are populated with 'NaN'. For all indeces greater than 2, there is
the same result.
  Perhaps this is allowed because, in real world data, the presence of any
any certain index is uncertain, so errors are not thrown when unpredictable
data might lack the necessary information.
