a.  Compare and contrast categorical vs numerical data
  Categorical data contains textual data (or strings), as implied in the name
(i.e. categories). It can also pertain to keywords or symbols which are
contained within the data.
  Numerical data involves data which are numbers
(integers or floats), but more specifically, data which is useful to treat as
numbers. Some numbers might be better treated as categories depending on the
context (zipcodes, etc.).

b.  Submit solutions to tasks 1â€“2. Include your best hyper-parameter values and
    the resulting RMSE, but not the training output.
Task 1:
    train_model(
        learning_rate=0.0001,
        steps=100,
        batch_size=1
    )
    Final RMSE (on training data): 169.46
Task 2:
    train_model(
        learning_rate=0.00004,
        steps=500,
        batch_size=5,
        input_feature='population'
    )
    Final RMSE (on training data): 176.09
  Not better than total_rooms with 10x faster learning rate, but still < 180.
