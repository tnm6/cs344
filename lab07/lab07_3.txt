a.  Submit solutions to tasks 1–3.
Task 1:
    california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = (
        california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"] /
        california_housing_dataframe["population"])

    calibration_data = train_model(
        learning_rate=0.04,
        steps=500,
        batch_size=5,
        input_feature="rooms_per_person"
    )
    Final RMSE (on training data): 130.73
Task 2:
    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])
  The plot shows almost a straight vertical line of points. There are
comparatively few points further out from the vertical line near 0.
Task 3:
    california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = (
        california_housing_dataframe.apply(lambda x: min(x, 5))
    # run using previous train_model settings (task 1)...
    Final RMSE (on training data): 109.58
  Setting an upper bound of 5 is based on the histogram shown in the solution
for task 2. Most of the examples were numbers less than 5. As shown, the RMSE
improves significantly using the same settings in task 1.

b.  What is the purpose of introducing synthetic features?
  Synthetic features combine the data from multiple other features, which can
produce better performance in training models (as seen in tasks 1–3). Some data
on its own might not be enough of a predictive factor, but combined with others
in some sort of combination or comparison (in this example, a ratio), it can
produce more interesting data, like block density based on total rooms to
population.

c.  What are outliers and what is typically done with them?
  They are data which do not fall within the majority range of the rest of the
data. This can cause statistical issues and inhibit the model from being
trained as well as it could be. As such, "clipping" them (i.e. removing them
from the utilized dataset) can actually improve performance, as the model is
able to focus on more reliable and trendy data.
