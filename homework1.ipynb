    "Introspection might offer some uniquely intimate insights into reasoning, emotions, and responses of individuals. In that way, it might offer some insight into how that might be modeled in an AI. At the same time, as a part of one's own perception, it might be difficult to ascertain reliable and quantifiable details that could translate to a computing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the reliability and accuracy of an individual's introspection could be problematic. What an individual perceives to be their mental processes may not be entirely accurate to what is really happening, and their perceptions could vary wildly from individual to individual. So modeling an AI on one person's perceptions of their mental processes might not only be inaccurate to how these processes really work, they might also be inconsistent with the processes of other individuals.
